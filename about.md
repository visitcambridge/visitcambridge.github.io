Visit Cambridge Ltd is a private business, founded by a team with strong ties to the City of Cambridge. Our mission is to showcase its rich history to visitors from around the world.

Tours are listed exclusively by Green and Blue Badge Guides, who are accredited by the Institute of Tourist Guiding. They spend at least a year in training, and are Cambridge residents.
