Visit Cambridge Ltd is a private business, founded by a team with strong ties to the City of Cambridge. Our mission is to showcase its beauty and rich history to visitors from around the world. We're not associated with <a class="primary-color" href="https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Cambridge City Council</a>, or its former destination management organisation (DMO), <a class="primary-color" href="https://www.visitcambridge.org/" target="_blank">Visit Cambridge and Beyond Ltd</a>. 

What can’t be re-created by things you’ll read or see online, are the memories that you’ll make when you visit Cambridge. There’s nothing quite like straining your neck to take in the magnitude of the vaulted ceilings of the Kings College Chapel, or getting sticky fingers whilst eating a Chelsea Bun at Fitzbilies. These venues are a key part of this city's history, but they’re nothing without the people who have called Cambridge home. 

Being a city that receives millions of visitors each year, the community of businesses that support this tourism industry have been incredibly hard hit. It will take years to fully comprehend the impact that this pandemic has had on the business but despite all this, we believe there is still hope. 

We’re thrilled to see Councillor Moore's dedication to building a more sustainable strategy for the Cambridge tourism industry. Visit Cambridge Ltd is proud to be a part of doing what we can to help the promote and engage with the community and businesses to ensure they can flourish as we tackle the problems raised by living in the ‘new normal’.

> We will work together with those who are committed to support the recovery of the local visitor economy in a sustainable way

Visit Cambridge Ltd is founded by a team of tech experts with extensive knowledge of building products that people love. We're committed to helping to connect the local community and businesses with people wanting to visit Cambridge.
