Whilst most of the more affordable hotels are on the edges of the city center, Cambridge itself is quite small so getting around won't take you long.

If you're just looking for a place to rest your head, then these hotels provide a great way to come and see the city at a price that won't break the bank.

On the slightly pricier end of affordable, the Regent hotel has a great location with some very unique rooms. Built in 1871 it was the original home of the first five Newnham College Students.

The Travelodge is a great option if you're looking for a cheaper night in Cambridge. A little way from the City Center its still very close to the Station.

A modern and building right next to the Station and a 10 minute walk to the city center. Much like every other ibis so you know the score.
