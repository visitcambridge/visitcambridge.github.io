## Best affordable hotels in Cambridge

Whilst most of the more affordable hotels are on the edges of the city center, Cambridge itself is quite small so getting around won't take you long.

If you're just looking for a place to rest your head, then these hotels provide a great way to come and see the city at a price that won't break the bank.

On the slightly pricier end of affordable, the Regent hotel has a great location with some very unique rooms. Built in 1871 it was the original home of the first five Newnham College Students.
